<h2>Twitter App</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Basically, we want to build a web app that takes information from the Twitter API with OAuth and visualize data based on the
hashtag. We want to be able to have the user enter in a hashtag and see how it is doing compared to other hashtags. We will
have a database with the user information on what hashtags they're wating and if the update, the table will update.</p>

<h3>Who Uses it?</h3>
